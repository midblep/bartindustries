						I am the core developer of the new Puppy Pride social
						network since January 2021, and continue to support and expand
						it to this day. The site was built from the ground up
						using the TALL stack in PHP (Tailwindcss, Alpine, Livewire and Laravel)
						and gave me a lot of experience working with not just PHP and every field inside Laravel,
						but also a very large array of different kinds of features and business processes at each step of development.
						<br /><br />
						Puppy Pride is an adult themed England based social network for people into petplay.
						The project is nearing its completion and will be released soon.
						You may find a beta release public at <a target="_blank" class="a" href="https://beta.puppypride.social">beta.puppypride.social</a>.

						Even though the university has taught me much about the business life and how to professionally work in teams, nearly all my programming knowledge is self taught at home.

						Great detail went into making sure no part of the site is boring, such as giving buttons that extra pop and even making a little blurred leaf pattern for the background on pages that get very long.

						Trick The Fox was made with NextJS using React in 2021. It had several updates over time later on and features some nice secrets.

						Hosted with Vercel, this package is completely free to run and maintain thanks to Airtable's free tier and its only cost are that of the domain.
