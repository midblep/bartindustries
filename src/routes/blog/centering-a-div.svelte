        My year 3 internship as part of my study at Saxion University, I chose to work for Agro IT, a small company that creates software solutions for several types of businesses. At the end of it, I was asked to launch what I made and was offered a job. In this post I'd like to touch a little more on what went right or wrong, and what the lessons were I learned while working there.
