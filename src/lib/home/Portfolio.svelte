                    I am the core developer of the new Puppy Pride social
                    network since January 2021, and continue to support and expand
                    it to this day. The site was built from the ground up
                    using the TALL stack in PHP (Tailwindcss, Alpine, Livewire and Laravel)
                    and gave me a lot of experience working with not just PHP and every field inside Laravel,
                    but also a very large array of different kinds of features and business processes at each step of development.
                    <br /><br />
                    Puppy Pride is an adult themed England based social network for people into petplay.
                    The project is nearing its completion and will be released soon.

                    I am a year 3 student at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands majoring in Software Engineering. The study keeps me plenty busy, but now I am combining the study with a Minor Entrepeneurship to build a SaaS product at my new company Flame Software.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Even though the university has taught me much about the business life and how to professionally work in teams, nearly all my programming knowledge is self taught at home.
