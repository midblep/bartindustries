                    During my study's internship at Agro IT I developed a beautiful and user friendly web environment for their RVDM suite by connecting it to their newly made API and Identity Server.<br/><br/>
                    The company liked what I had built, and wanted to expand upon it, so they hired me after the internship so I can transform the internship's prototype to something we can roll out and release to clients.<br/><br/>
                    After that I am expected to build other modules of Agro IT's products into web environments so that their clients will eventually no longer need the older application-style programs.

                                The site was built from the ground up using the TALL (Laravel) stack and sports a large array of features such as blogging, albums, subscriptions, events, instant messaging, customizable profiles, feeds, groups and advanced group management, and so on.
