				<b class="text-xl">üñ• Computer tech</b>
				<p>
					I love everything tech, as was probably obvious. But it goes beyond creating software.
					I also built my own computer, and like to maintain hardware. At home I run a server rack equipped with a few Dell processing servers, doing my own research and hosting webservers, bots, multiplayer games and more using software like TrueNAS, Proxmox and Linux.
					<br/><br/>
					I daily-drive Linux as my operating systems out of a passion for FOSS and often tinker around with things like RAID and backups and getting all my favorite games to run.

				<p>
					Being a furry is an important hobby and a creative outlet for me. In the digital world I express myself as Mid, he is an anthropomorphic cat with black fur and blue hair and some unusually large whiskers, and he's my main character. You'll see Mid in some places on this website. There are also Martin the pine marten, Seffy the protogen, Koffie the rexouium and many more.

				I like to go out there and make drone videos and pictures with my DJI drones, enjoying nature outdoors and capturing its beauty.
