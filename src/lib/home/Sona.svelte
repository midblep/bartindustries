				Mid <sup>(aka Midnight)</sup> is my primary fursona out of the many that I have accumulated over the years. He is a fictional character that I use and represent myself with online, one that I have grown comfortable with. I commission artists to create depictions of him to bring him to life, showing and using him on places like this website.
				<br/><br/>
				Mid is a cat with black fur and blue hair that stands twice as tall as the people around him. He loves coffee perhaps a bit too much, as any good programmer does, and likes to stay busy.
				Some noticable traits are his unusually large whiskers, the white moon-shaped spot of fur on his chest, and his fluffy tail.
