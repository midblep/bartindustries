				Mid <sup>(aka Midnight)</sup> is my primary fursona out of the many that I have created over the years. He is a fictional anthropomorphic cat with black fur and blue hair and some unusually large whiskers. I use Mid to represent myself with online, an image I have grown comfortable with. I commission artists to create depictions of him to bring him to life, showing and using him on places like this website.
